# minecraft-kawalu
Minecraft translated to Kawalu

## What the hell is this?
Kawalu is a constructed language. Because yes.

## Usage
Click Code, and then click Download ZIP. Extract it and copy the ``minecraft-kawalu-main`` folder to your resourcepacks folder.

Apply the resource pack in the Settings, then go back and click Language and select ``kawalu (Willow)`` and click Done.

All currently translated strings will then be changed to Kawalu.

## Credits
Credits to my friend [Luna](https://github.com/lunakittyyy) for making the original project many moons ago, before I remade the whole language from the ground up
